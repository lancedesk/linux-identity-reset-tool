# Linux Identity Reset Tool

A comprehensive bash script for Linux systems that resets system fingerprints, cleans application traces, and provides complete system identity randomization with full backup/restore capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

- **Complete System Identity Reset**: Changes machine ID, hostname, and MAC addresses
- **Application Cleanup**: Removes Cursor/VS Code configurations and traces
- **Safety First**: Comprehensive backup system with one-command restore
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview all changes before execution
- **Root Privilege Management**: Smart detection and handling of sudo requirements
- **Browser Data Cleanup**: Clears Firefox, Chrome, and other browser traces
- **History Cleaning**: Removes shell command histories
- **Network Identity**: Randomizes MAC addresses for all network interfaces

## üìã Prerequisites

- Linux system (tested on Kali Linux)
- `sudo` privileges for system-level changes
- `macchanger` (automatically installed if missing)
- `systemd` (for hostname management)

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lancedesk/linux-identity-reset-tool.git
   cd linux-identity-reset-tool
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x reset_machine.sh
   ```

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Preview changes without making them (RECOMMENDED FIRST)
./reset_machine.sh --dry-run

# Interactive mode with confirmations
./reset_machine.sh

# Run with root privileges for full system changes
sudo ./reset_machine.sh

# Restore original system state
./reset_machine.sh undo

# Show help
./reset_machine.sh --help
```

### Example Workflow

1. **First, see what would change:**
   ```bash
   ./reset_machine.sh --dry-run
   ```

2. **Run the reset:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./reset_machine.sh
   ```

3. **If needed, restore everything:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./reset_machine.sh undo
   ```

## üìä What Gets Changed

### System Identifiers
- `/etc/machine-id` - System machine identifier
- `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id` - D-Bus machine identifier  
- `hostname` and `/etc/hostname` - System hostname
- MAC addresses for all network interfaces

### Application Data
- `~/.cursor` - Cursor editor configurations
- `~/.vscode` - VS Code configurations
- `~/.config/Cursor` - Cursor app data
- `~/.config/Code` - VS Code app data
- Browser caches and profiles
- Shell command histories

### Generated Changes
- **New hostname**: Random format like `host-a1b2c3d4`
- **New MAC addresses**: Completely randomized for all interfaces
- **New machine IDs**: Fresh system identifiers
- **Clean histories**: Cleared bash/zsh command histories

## üîí Safety Features

### Comprehensive Backup
The script creates a detailed backup file (`~/.fingerprint_reset_backup`) containing:
- Original hostname and `/etc/hostname`
- Original machine ID and D-Bus machine ID
- MAC addresses for all network interfaces
- Timestamp and system information

### Privilege Checking
- Detects if running as root or with sudo access
- Provides clear error messages for insufficient privileges
- Suggests using `--dry-run` for testing without privileges

### Dry-Run Mode
- Shows exactly what files would be deleted
- Previews all system changes before execution
- Safe testing without making any modifications

## üìñ Command Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without executing them |
| `--help` | Display usage information |
| `undo` | Restore system from backup |
| _(no args)_ | Run in interactive mode |

## üé® Sample Output

### Before Reset
```
=== Current System Fingerprints ===
Machine ID: fff172744a6245cda94e6dd013bf4753
Hostname: old-hostname
MAC Addresses:
  14:58:d0:03:3f:4a
  10:4a:7d:bc:51:ec
```

### After Reset
```
=== New Fingerprints ===
Machine ID: 75bf9b225da2448bed95504168cc2a8b
Hostname: host-c44e08l0
MAC Addresses:
  26:19:c8:3c:65:02
  de:61:87:b9:20:e7
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Post-Reset Actions
- **Reboot recommended** after running the script
- Some changes may require a fresh terminal session
- Network connections may need to be re-established

### Backup File Location
- **User mode**: `$HOME/.fingerprint_reset_backup`
- **Root mode**: `/root/.fingerprint_reset_backup`

### Network Interfaces
- Only non-loopback interfaces are modified
- Interface names are auto-detected (`eth0`, `wlan0`, etc.)
- Original MAC addresses are backed up for restoration

## üõ°Ô∏è Use Cases

- **Privacy Enhancement**: Change system fingerprints for privacy
- **Development Testing**: Test software behavior with different system IDs  
- **Virtualization**: Reset VM fingerprints after cloning
- **Security Research**: Legitimate penetration testing scenarios
- **System Administration**: Clean slate after system deployment

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Sudo privileges required"**
- Run with `sudo ./reset_machine.sh` 
- Or use `--dry-run` to preview without privileges

**"No backup found"**
- Backup is only created when running fingerprint reset
- Each reset overwrites the previous backup

**"macchanger not found"**
- Script automatically installs it via `apt-get`
- Manual install: `sudo apt-get install macchanger`

### Recovery
If something goes wrong, you can always restore:
```bash
sudo ./reset_machine.sh undo
```
